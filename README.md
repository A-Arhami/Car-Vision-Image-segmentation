# Car-Vision-Image-segmentation
Pixel wise classification of elements (road, buildings, sky, sidewalk, and etc) of images of a car camera using a Deep learning model(U-Net)
~Semantic image segmentation predicts a label for every single pixel in an image
~U-Net uses an equal number of convolutional blocks and transposed convolutions for downsampling and upsampling
~Skip connections are used to prevent border pixel information loss and overfitting in U-Net
semantic image segmentation is a very important task for self-driving cars to get right.

#####NOTE##### If you have issues loading the notebook on github (as github have some backend malefunctions loading Jupyter notebook files) you can see the codes from nbviewer :
